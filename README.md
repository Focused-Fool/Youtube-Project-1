# Youtube-Project-1

## YouTube Layout Clone

### Description
This project is a **recreation of YouTube's layout** using only **HTML and CSS**. The layout includes the header, sidebar, video previews, and thumbnails, resembling YouTube's design as closely as possible. It is an excellent example of implementing modular CSS and structuring code for scalability and readability.

### Features:
- **Header**: Styled using `header.css`, mimicking YouTube's top navigation bar.
- **Sidebar**: Recreated with `sidebar.css`, displaying navigation options and categories.
- **Video Previews**: Designed with `video.css`, showcasing video thumbnails, titles, and channel details.
- **General Styles**: Encapsulated in `general.css` for shared styles across the project.
- **Asset Organization**: Images (thumbnails, channel icons, sidebar icons) are neatly categorized in folders.
